# Week-1-Toy-problems
This repository contains three JavaScript functions that perform different calculations based on user inputs.

Function 1: salaryCalculator
This function prompts the user to enter their gross salary and calculates the following deductions:

NSSF (fixed rate of 360)
NHIF (variable rate based on gross salary)
PAYE (tax rate based on gross salary)
The function then calculates the net pay by subtracting the deductions from the gross salary and returns the result.

To run this function, simply call the salaryCalculator function in your code. The function does not require any additional input parameters.

Function 2: inputSpeed
This function prompts the user to enter the speed of their car and calculates the demerit points based on the speed limit (70 km/h) and a conversion rate (5 km/h per point).

If the car's speed is within the speed limit, the function returns "Ok". If the car's speed is above the speed limit, the function calculates the number of demerit points and returns the result. If the number of demerit points exceeds the maximum allowed (12), the function returns "License suspended".

To run this function, simply call the inputSpeed function in your code. The function does not require any additional input parameters.

Function 3: inputMarks
This function prompts the user to enter a student's mark and calculates the corresponding grade based on the following boundaries:

A: 80-100
B: 60-79
C: 50-59
D: 40-49
E: 0-39
The function then returns the calculated grade.

To run this function, simply call the inputMarks function in your code. The function does not require any additional input parameters.
